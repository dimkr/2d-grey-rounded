2D-grey-rounded GTK Theme
===========================

This is the fork of the [Raleigh Reloaded](https://github.com/vlastavesely/raleigh-reloaded) theme, similar to the [Flat-grey-rounded Puppy Linux GTK 2 theme](https://distro.ibiblio.org/puppylinux/pet_packages-noarch/gtk_theme_flat_grey_rounded-1.pet) but without speudo-3D elements.
